\section{Material parameters}
CSF is modeled as water at $37^o C$, i.e
\[ \mu_f = 0.653\cdot 10^{-3}\,\, Ns/m^2 \]
\[ \nu_f = 0.658\cdot 10^{-6}\,\, m^2/s \]
\[ \rho_f = 1000\,\,kg/m^3 \]
For the spinal cord, studies have shown a huge variety in material parameters. One of the most measured properties in the mammalian central nervous system is probably the Young's modulus, $E$. [Smith, Humphrey 2006]. In addition to this, values for the Poisson ratio, $\nu_P$ needs to be found. Smith and Huphrey used the following values for these parameters. 
\[ E = 5*10^4 \text{dyn}/cm^2  = 5000 \text{ Pa}\]
\[ \nu_P = 0.479 \]
From this, Lame's parameters for the spinal cord were determined as
\[ \mu_s = \frac{E}{2(1 + \nu_P)} = 1.7 \cdot 10^3 \text{ Pa}\]
\[ \lambda_s = \frac{\nu_P E}{(1 + \nu_P)(1-2\nu_P)} = 3.9 \cdot 10^4 \text{ Pa}\]
The permeability, $\kappa$ is used as a measurement for the how fluid flows in a porous medium. A large permeability indicates a pervious medium. We use the value from [Karen, Ida]
\[ \kappa = 1.4\cdot 10^{-15} m^2 \]
